/**
 * CrudRepository for the Movies entity.
 * <p>
 * MovieRepository extends the MongoRepository interface and plugs in the
 * type of values and id it works with: Movie and String.
 * Out-of-the-box, this interface comes with many operations, including standard
 * CRUD operations (create-read-update-delete).
 * <p>
 * It's possibile to define other queries as needed by simply declaring their method signature.
 * In this case, we defined findByName, which essentially seeks documents of type Movie and
 * finds the one that matches on name.
 * <p>
 * In a typical Java application, we write a class that implements MovieRepository
 * and craft the queries yourself. What makes Spring Data MongoDB so useful is the fact that you
 * donâ€™t have to create this implementation.
 * Spring Data MongoDB creates it on the fly when you run the application.
